        <p>Most papers and cardboards are recyclable. You can recycle newspapers, pizza boxes, 
            magazines, mail, and much more. Cardboard lined with plastic or wax cannot be recycled. 
            Cardboard containers are recyclable, just make to break them down and flatten them 
            before placing them in the bin.
